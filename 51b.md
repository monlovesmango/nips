`draft` `optional` `author:fiatjaf` `author:arcbtc` `author:monlovesmango` `author:eskema` 

An event with kind `30001` is defined as a list event (see [NIP-51 - Lists](51.md)) for note events (or kind 1 events). The list of tags should follow the format for "e" tags as defined in [NIP-10 - Conventions for clients' use of e and p tags in text events](10.md).

Commonly established list parameter names for this kind are:
- `mute` - a list of tags that the user wants to mute
- `follow` - a list of tags that the user wants to follow
- `pin` - a list of tags that the user wants to pin (for display on profile)
- `bookmark` - a list of tags that the user wants to bookmark

Outside of the commonly established list parameter names above, users are allowed to create lists with custom names.
