An event with kind `30000` is defined as a list event (see [NIP-51 - Lists](51.md)) for user public keys. The list of tags should follow the format of kind 3 events as defined in [NIP-02 - Contact List and Petnames](02.md).

Commonly established list parameter names for this kind are:
- `mute` - a list of tags that the user wants to mute
- `follow` - a list of tags that the user wants to follow
- `pin` - a list of tags that the user wants to pin (for display on profile)
- `bookmark` - a list of tags that the user wants to bookmark

Outside of the commonly established list parameter names above, users are allowed to create lists with custom names.
